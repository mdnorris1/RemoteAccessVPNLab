# Remote Access VPN Lab

You work as the IT security administrator for a small corporate network. Occasionally, you and your co-administrators need to access internal resources when you are away from the office. You would like to set up a Remote Access VPN using pfSense to allow secure access.
In this lab, your task is to use the pfSense wizard to create and configure an OpenVPN Remote Access server
